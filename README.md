## Pixelate Images and Convert to C Animation Structs

This tool helps you convert PNG images (or a sequence of images) into C structs suitable for use in embedded animation projects. It pixelates images to a fixed grid, extracts brightness data, and generates C code for animation frames.

### Features

- **Pixelate images** to a fixed grid (default: 18x11).
- **Batch process** a directory of PNGs into a C array of animation frames.
- **Single image** conversion supported.
- **Outputs C structs** ready for use in microcontroller or embedded projects.
